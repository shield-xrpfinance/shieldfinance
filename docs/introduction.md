# Introduction to Shield Yield Vaults

Shield Yield Vaults is a comprehensive XRP liquid staking protocol that enables users to deposit XRP, RLUSD, and USDC into high-yield vaults while maintaining liquidity.

## What is Liquid Staking?

Liquid staking allows you to earn staking rewards on your crypto assets while maintaining the flexibility to use those assets in DeFi protocols. Unlike traditional staking where assets are locked, liquid staking provides:

- **Continuous Liquidity**: Your assets remain accessible
- **Yield Generation**: Earn APY on deposited assets
