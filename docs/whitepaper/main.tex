\section*{Abstract}

\begin{multicols}{2}

Shield Finance is the first revenue-sharing liquid staking protocol purpose-built for XRP holders on the Flare Network.

Users deposit XRP (via Xaman or any XRPL wallet) and instantly receive \textbf{shXRP} --- a fully liquid, ERC-4626-compliant token that earns real yield from Flare's native staking and FAssets delegation rewards while remaining instantly redeemable 1:1 for XRP.

Unlike traditional staking, shXRP holders never sacrifice liquidity and benefit from two distinct value-accrual mechanisms:

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{1. Base Yield (7--13\% APY)}

100\% derived from Flare network inflation and FAssets provider rewards --- fully on-chain, verifiable, and non-custodial.

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{2. SHIELD Boost (up to +25\% additional APY)}

A portion of real protocol revenue (0.2\% deposit + 0.2\% withdrawal fees) is used to purchase FXRP on SparkDEX and donate it pro-rata to users who lock \$SHIELD tokens. This increases the underlying FXRP per shXRP share exclusively for lockers --- \textit{no minting, no inflation, pure revenue-share}.

% PROBLEM STATEMENT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection*{XRP Holders Are Stuck in a 0\% Yield World}

\begin{multicols}{2}

As of November 2025, more than \textbf{55 billion XRP} remain dormant in wallets earning exactly \textbf{0\% annual yield}.

Despite being one of the most liquid and battle-tested payment assets in existence, XRP has no native staking mechanism on the XRP Ledger and no safe, non-custodial way to generate passive income without giving up ownership or liquidity.

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{The result:} Less than 2\% of all XRP supply is currently earning any meaningful yield.

\end{multicols}

\vspace{1em}

\subsection*{Existing Solutions Fall Short}

\toprule
\textbf{Solution} & \textbf{Liquidity} & \textbf{Trust Model} & \textbf{Yield Source} & \textbf{Real-World Result} \\
\midrule
CEX lending (ByBit, etc.) & Locked & Custodial & Counterparty lending & Users lost funds in 2022--2023 collapses \\
\addlinespace
Wrapped XRP on Ethereum/CEXs & Variable & Custodial bridge & Off-chain yields & High fees, bridge exploits, depegs \\
\addlinespace
Flare FAssets (FXRP) manual staking & Full & Non-custodial & Flare staking $\sim$8--10\% & Requires 21 steps, EVM wallet, and active management \\
\addlinespace
Existing Flare vaults & Full & Mixed & Often opaque or leveraged & No revenue sharing, no boost, no XRPL-native UX \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\newpage

\subsection*{The Core Problems Shield Finance Solves}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\textbf{1. Liquidity vs. Yield Trade-off}

Traditional staking forces users to lock assets for weeks or months. XRP holders refuse to do this.

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{2. Complexity Barrier}

To earn Flare staking rewards today, an XRPL user must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bridge XRP $\rightarrow$ FXRP via FAssets (multi-day finality)
    \item Move to an EVM wallet
    \item Manually delegate to FTSO + FDC providers every 7 days
\end{itemize}

\textbf{$\Rightarrow$ 97\% of XRP holders never complete this flow.}

\columnbreak

\textbf{3. Missing Value Accrual for Governance Token Holders}

Most liquid staking protocols either:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inflate their token with emissions (unsustainable), or
    \item Capture zero fee revenue for token holders (dead token).
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{4. No Institutional-Grade Product Exists}

Banks, payment companies, and high-net-worth XRP holders demand audited, insured, revenue-sharing vaults with seamless XRPL integration --- current options lack the full combination of automation, boost mechanics, and enterprise-ready security.

\end{multicols}

\subsection*{Multi-Strategy Yield Optimization}

The ShXRPVault employs a \textbf{dynamic buffer model} to balance instant liquidity with maximum yield generation:

\vspace{0.5em}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{10\% Buffer} --- Retained in vault for instant withdrawals
    \item \textbf{90\% Deployed} --- Actively earning yield across strategies
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5em}

When the buffer falls below threshold, the vault automatically rebalances by withdrawing from the lowest-priority strategy first.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% YIELD BOOST MECHANICS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Yield Boost Mechanics}

\subsection*{Mathematical Framework}

The SHIELD boost mechanism uses a \textbf{Synthetix-style reward accumulator} for gas-efficient, pro-rata distribution. This ensures O(1) complexity regardless of the number of stakers.

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Let:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V$ = Total assets in the shXRP vault (FXRP)
    \item $S$ = Total circulating supply of shXRP shares
    \item $L$ = Total amount of SHIELD currently locked in StakingBoost
    \item $L_i$ = Amount of SHIELD locked by user $i$
    \item $B_t$ = Amount of FXRP donated as boost during week $t$ (sourced from protocol fee revenue)
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5em}

The boost is distributed \textbf{strictly pro-rata} to locked SHIELD positions:

\begin{equation}
\text{Boost received by user } i = B_t \times \frac{L_i}{L}
\end{equation}

This FXRP amount immediately becomes part of the vault's underlying assets and is credited exclusively to user $i$'s position via \texttt{donateOnBehalf(i, $B_t \times L_i / L$)}.

\vspace{0.5em}

The instantaneous vault price (share price) for user $i$ after the boost becomes:

\begin{equation}
P_i = \frac{V + B_t}{S} \times \left(1 + \frac{L_i}{L} \times \frac{B_t}{V + B_t}\right) \quad \text{(approximate, for small boosts)}
\end{equation}

\vspace{0.5em}

More importantly, the \textbf{effective extra APY} that locked SHIELD earns from the boost program is:

\begin{equation}
\text{Boost APY}_i = \text{Base APY} \times \left(1 + \underbrace{\frac{L_i}{L} \times \frac{B_t}{V} \times 52}_{\text{boost multiplier}}\right) \quad \text{(annualized)}
\end{equation}

\vspace{0.5em}

Or, in its cleanest form (the one every auditor loves):

\begin{tcolorbox}[
    colback=shieldlight,
    colframe=shieldblue,
    boxrule=2pt,
    arc=5pt,
    left=10pt,
    right=10pt,
    top=10pt,
    bottom=10pt
]
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\text{Total APY}_i = \text{Flare Staking APY} + \left(\frac{B_{\text{annual}}}{V}\right) \times \frac{L_i}{L}}
\end{equation}
\end{tcolorbox}

\vspace{0.3em}

\noindent Where $B_{\text{annual}}$ is the total FXRP donated via the boost program over one year.

\vspace{0.5em}

\noindent\textit{Note: The 25\% boost cap is a soft ceiling to protect long-term sustainability and may be supplemented by treasury FXRP during low-fee periods if approved by governance.}

\vspace{0.5em}

\subsection*{Reward Accumulator Pattern}

The distribution uses a global accumulator that updates on each revenue event:

\begin{align}
\texttt{rewardPerTokenStored} &\mathrel{+}= \frac{\texttt{fxrpAmount} \times 10^{18}}{\texttt{totalStaked}} \\[1em]
\texttt{earned}(u) &= \texttt{stake}_u \times \frac{\texttt{rewardPerTokenStored} - \texttt{userRewardPerTokenPaid}_u}{10^{18}}
\end{align}

This pattern enables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{O(1) gas complexity} for distribution (no loops)
    \item \textbf{Late-joiner fairness} (only earn from post-stake distributions)
    \item \textbf{Precise accounting} (no rounding errors over time)
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}

\subsection*{Example Distribution}

Assume \$10,000 in weekly vault fees (wFLR):

\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\begin{tabular}{@{} >{\bfseries}l r l @{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Allocation} & \textbf{Amount} & \textbf{Destination} \\
\midrule
50\% Burn & \$5,000 & Buy SHIELD $\rightarrow$ Burn address \\
40\% Boost & \$4,000 & Swap to FXRP $\rightarrow$ StakingBoost \\
10\% Reserves & \$1,000 & Protocol treasury \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{1em}

The \$4,000 FXRP is distributed pro-rata to stakers:

\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\begin{tabular}{@{} l r r r @{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Staker} & \textbf{SHIELD Staked} & \textbf{Share of Total} & \textbf{FXRP Reward} \\
\midrule
Alice & 10,000 SHIELD & 50\% & \$2,000 \\
Bob & 6,000 SHIELD & 30\% & \$1,200 \\
Carol & 4,000 SHIELD & 20\% & \$800 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Total} & \textbf{20,000 SHIELD} & \textbf{100\%} & \textbf{\$4,000} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{0.5em}

When stakers call \texttt{claim()}, the FXRP is deposited via \texttt{vault.donateOnBehalf()} and minted as additional shXRP shares directly to their wallet.

Every week the protocol donates FXRP bought with real revenue. 100\% of that donation is distributed pro-rata to SHIELD lockers:

\subsection*{Key Differentiators}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\textbf{For XRP Holders:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Instant liquidity (no lock-up)
    \item 7--13\% base APY from real staking
    \item Native XRPL wallet support (Xaman)
    \item 1-click UX (no EVM complexity)
\end{itemize}

\columnbreak

\textbf{For SHIELD Stakers:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Up to +25\% additional APY boost
    \item Real revenue share (not emissions)
    \item Deflationary tokenomics (50\% burns)
    \item Governance rights (future)
\end{itemize}

\section{Appendix: Smart Contract Architecture}

\subsection*{Contract Overview}

\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\begin{tabular}{@{} l l p{7cm} @{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Contract} & \textbf{Standard} & \textbf{Purpose} \\
\midrule
ShXRPVault & ERC-4626 & Liquid staking vault with deposit/withdraw \\
ShieldToken & ERC-20 & Governance token with burn function \\
StakingBoost & Custom & Synthetix-style reward accumulator \\
RevenueRouter & Custom & Fee splitting (50/40/10) and swaps \\
VaultController & Access Control & Emergency pause and admin functions \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{1.5em}

\subsection*{Deployment Dependency Resolution}

StakingBoost and ShXRPVault have a circular dependency solved via three-step deployment:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    node distance=0.7cm,
    box/.style={
        rectangle,
        rounded corners=3pt,
        draw=shieldblue,
        fill=shieldlight,
        line width=1pt,
        minimum height=0.7cm,
        minimum width=10cm,
        text centered,
        font=\small
    },
    myarrow/.style={
        ->,
        >={Stealth[length=2mm]},
        line width=1pt,
        draw=shieldblue
    }
]

\node[box] (step1) {\textbf{Step 1:} Deploy ShXRPVault with \texttt{stakingBoost = address(0)}};
\node[box, below=of step1] (step2) {\textbf{Step 2:} Deploy StakingBoost with real vault address};
\node[box, below=of step2] (step3) {\textbf{Step 3:} Call \texttt{vault.setStakingBoost()} (one-time setter)};

\draw[myarrow] (step1) -- (step2);
\draw[myarrow] (step2) -- (step3);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\vspace{1em}

\subsection*{Security Properties}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ReentrancyGuard}: All state-changing functions protected
    \item \textbf{Access Control}: Role-based permissions via OpenZeppelin
    \item \textbf{One-Time Setter}: \texttt{setStakingBoost()} cannot be called twice
    \item \textbf{Pausable}: Emergency circuit breaker on vault deposits
    \item \textbf{Non-Custodial}: No admin access to user funds
\end{itemize}
