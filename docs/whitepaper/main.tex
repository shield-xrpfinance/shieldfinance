\section*{Abstract}

\begin{multicols}{2}

Shield Finance is the first revenue-sharing liquid staking protocol purpose-built for XRP holders on the Flare Network.

Users deposit XRP (via Xaman or any XRPL wallet) and instantly receive \textbf{shXRP} --- a fully liquid, ERC-4626-compliant token that earns real yield from Flare's native staking and FAssets delegation rewards while remaining instantly redeemable 1:1 for XRP.

Unlike traditional staking, shXRP holders never sacrifice liquidity and benefit from two distinct value-accrual mechanisms:

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{1. Base Yield (7--13\% APY)}

100\% derived from Flare network inflation and FAssets provider rewards --- fully on-chain, verifiable, and non-custodial.

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{2. SHIELD Boost (up to +25\% additional APY)}

A portion of real protocol revenue (0.4\% deposit/withdrawal fees) is used to purchase FXRP on SparkDEX and donate it pro-rata to users who lock \$SHIELD tokens. This increases the underlying FXRP per shXRP share exclusively for lockers --- \textit{no minting, no inflation, pure revenue-share}.

\end{multicols}

% PROBLEM STATEMENT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection*{XRP Holders Are Stuck in a 0\% Yield World}

\begin{multicols}{2}

As of December 2025, more than \textbf{55 billion XRP} remain dormant in wallets earning exactly \textbf{0\% annual yield}.

Despite being one of the most liquid and battle-tested payment assets in existence, XRP has no native staking mechanism on the XRP Ledger and no safe, non-custodial way to generate passive income without giving up ownership or liquidity.

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{The result:} Less than 2\% of all XRP supply is currently earning any meaningful yield.

\end{multicols}

\vspace{1em}

\subsection*{Existing Solutions Fall Short}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{@{} l c c X X @{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Solution} & \textbf{Liquidity} & \textbf{Trust Model} & \textbf{Yield Source} & \textbf{Real-World Result} \\
\midrule
CEX lending (ByBit, etc.) & Locked & Custodial & Counterparty lending & Users lost funds in 2022--2023 collapses \\
\addlinespace
Wrapped XRP on Ethereum/CEXs & Variable & Custodial bridge & Off-chain yields & High fees, bridge exploits, depegs \\
\addlinespace
Flare FAssets (FXRP) manual staking & Full & Non-custodial & Flare staking $\sim$8--10\% & Requires 21 steps, EVM wallet, and active management \\
\addlinespace
Existing Flare vaults & Full & Mixed & Often opaque or leveraged & No revenue sharing, no boost, no XRPL-native UX \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\vspace{1.5em}

\subsection*{The Core Problems Shield Finance Solves}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\textbf{1. Liquidity vs. Yield Trade-off}

Traditional staking forces users to lock assets for weeks or months. XRP holders refuse to do this.

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{2. Complexity Barrier}

To earn Flare staking rewards today, an XRPL user must:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bridge XRP $\rightarrow$ FXRP via FAssets (multi-day finality)
    \item Move to an EVM wallet
    \item Manually delegate to FTSO + FDC providers every 7 days
\end{itemize}

\textbf{$\Rightarrow$ 97\% of XRP holders never complete this flow.}

\columnbreak

\textbf{3. Missing Value Accrual for Governance Token Holders}

Most liquid staking protocols either:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inflate their token with emissions (unsustainable), or
    \item Capture zero fee revenue for token holders (dead token).
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{4. No Institutional-Grade Product Exists}

Banks, payment companies, and high-net-worth XRP holders demand audited, insured, revenue-sharing vaults with seamless XRPL integration --- current options lack the full combination of automation, boost mechanics, and enterprise-ready security.

\end{multicols}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% YIELD BOOST MECHANICS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Yield Boost Mechanics}

\subsection*{Mathematical Framework}

\begin{multicols}{2}

The SHIELD boost mechanism uses a \textbf{Synthetix-style reward accumulator} for gas-efficient, pro-rata distribution. This ensures O(1) complexity regardless of the number of stakers.

\vspace{0.5em}

\textbf{Let:}
\begin{align*}
R &= \text{Annual Protocol Revenue (in FXRP)} \\
S_i &= \text{Your locked SHIELD balance} \\
S_{\text{total}} &= \text{Total locked SHIELD} \\
B &= \text{Boost allocation (40\%)}
\end{align*}

\columnbreak

\textbf{Core Formula:}

\begin{tcolorbox}[
    colback=shieldlight,
    colframe=shieldblue,
    boxrule=2pt,
    arc=5pt,
    left=10pt,
    right=10pt,
    top=10pt,
    bottom=10pt
]
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\text{Boost APY} = \text{Base APY} + \frac{R \times B \times S_i}{S_{\text{total}}}}
\end{equation}
\end{tcolorbox}

\end{multicols}

\vspace{0.5em}

\subsection*{Reward Accumulator Pattern}

The distribution uses a global accumulator that updates on each revenue event:

\begin{align}
\texttt{rewardPerTokenStored} &\mathrel{+}= \frac{\texttt{fxrpAmount} \times 10^{18}}{\texttt{totalStaked}} \\[1em]
\texttt{earned}(u) &= \texttt{stake}_u \times \frac{\texttt{rewardPerTokenStored} - \texttt{userRewardPerTokenPaid}_u}{10^{18}}
\end{align}

This pattern enables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{O(1) gas complexity} for distribution (no loops)
    \item \textbf{Late-joiner fairness} (only earn from post-stake distributions)
    \item \textbf{Precise accounting} (no rounding errors over time)
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1em}

\subsection*{Example Distribution}

Assume \$10,000 in weekly vault fees (wFLR):

\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\begin{tabular}{@{} >{\bfseries}l r l @{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Allocation} & \textbf{Amount} & \textbf{Destination} \\
\midrule
50\% Burn & \$5,000 & Buy SHIELD $\rightarrow$ Burn address \\
40\% Boost & \$4,000 & Swap to FXRP $\rightarrow$ StakingBoost \\
10\% Reserves & \$1,000 & Protocol treasury \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{1em}

The \$4,000 FXRP is distributed pro-rata to stakers:

\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\begin{tabular}{@{} l r r r @{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Staker} & \textbf{SHIELD Staked} & \textbf{Share of Total} & \textbf{FXRP Reward} \\
\midrule
Alice & 10,000 SHIELD & 50\% & \$2,000 \\
Bob & 6,000 SHIELD & 30\% & \$1,200 \\
Carol & 4,000 SHIELD & 20\% & \$800 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Total} & \textbf{20,000 SHIELD} & \textbf{100\%} & \textbf{\$4,000} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{0.5em}

When stakers call \texttt{claim()}, the FXRP is deposited via \texttt{vault.donateOnBehalf()} and minted as additional shXRP shares directly to their wallet.
