   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Publish on Replit**
   - Use the "Publish" button in Replit
   - Configure custom domain (optional)
   - SSL/TLS handled automatically

## 📊 Liquid Staking System

### Deposit Flow
1. **User sends XRP** to monitored XRPL address: `r4bydXhaVMFzgDmqDmxkXJBKUgXTCwsWjY`
2. **Automated FAssets bridge** converts XRP → FXRP on Flare Network
3. **FXRP deposited** into ERC-4626 vault contract
4. **User receives shXRP** liquid staking tokens representing their position

### Smart Contracts (Flare Coston2 Testnet)
- **ShXRP Vault**: [`0x8fe09217445e90DA692D29F30859dafA4eb281d1`](https://coston2-explorer.flare.network/address/0x8fe09217445e90DA692D29F30859dafA4eb281d1)
  - ERC-4626 compliant tokenized vault
  - Minimum deposit: 0.01 FXRP
  - Decimal precision: 6 (matches FXRP)
  
- **Smart Account**: [`0x0C2b9f0a5A61173324bC08Fb9C1Ef91a791a4DDd`](https://coston2-explorer.flare.network/address/0x0C2b9f0a5A61173324bC08Fb9C1Ef91a791a4DDd)
  - ERC-4337 smart account via Etherspot Prime SDK
  - Enables gasless transactions for users
  - Manages vault deposits and withdrawals

### Withdrawal Flow
Users can withdraw anytime through the vault's standard ERC-4626 `redeem()` function:
1. **User initiates withdrawal** from dashboard
2. **Smart account executes** ERC-4626 redeem transaction (gasless)
3. **FXRP returned** to user's Flare wallet
4. **shXRP tokens burned** maintaining proper accounting

No manual approvals required - all withdrawals are automated and instant via smart contracts.

## 🔥 $10K Fair Launch – Live

**Shield Finance ($SHIELD)** has successfully launched with a **$10,000 liquidity commitment** and **100% LP tokens locked for 12 months** on **SparkDEX V3** (Flare mainnet).

### Tokenomics

- **Total Supply**: 10,000,000 SHIELD
- **Circulating**: 8,000,000 SHIELD (80%)
  - 5,353,451 SHIELD + 535,451 wFLR = $10K initial liquidity
  - 2,646,549 SHIELD reserved for ecosystem development
- **Airdrop**: 2,000,000 SHIELD (20%)
  - Claimable via Merkle proof (MerkleDistributor.sol)
  - Fair distribution to early supporters
- **Initial Price**: $0.01 per SHIELD
- **Liquidity Lock**: 12 months via Team Finance (or equivalent)

### Revenue Model: Real Burns, No Inflation

Shield Finance generates **real revenue** from vault fees, creating **deflationary pressure** through automated buyback & burn:

1. **Deposit Fee (0.2%)**: Collected on every vault deposit → sent to RevenueRouter
2. **Withdrawal Fee (0.2%)**: Collected on every vault withdrawal → sent to RevenueRouter
3. **Automated Burns**: Every Sunday, GitHub Actions checks if RevenueRouter has ≥5000 wFLR (~$100):
   - If yes → calls `distribute()` to execute buyback & burn on SparkDEX
   - SHIELD is bought from DEX using accumulated wFLR
   - Purchased SHIELD is permanently burned
   - Reduces total supply, increasing scarcity

**No minting. No inflation. Only burns.** As vault TVL grows, burn rate accelerates.

### Stake $SHIELD → Boost Your shXRP Yield

**LIVE — Stake SHIELD to boost your shXRP APY up to 2.5x**

SHIELD holders can stake their tokens to receive proportionally higher yield on their shXRP holdings:

- **Stake SHIELD**: Lock tokens for 30 days in StakingBoost contract
- **Earn Boost**: +1% APY per 100 SHIELD staked (e.g., 1000 SHIELD = +10% APY)
- **Weighted Distribution**: Revenue fees are converted to FXRP and distributed to stakers using Synthetix-style accumulator
- **Claim Rewards**: Call `claim()` to convert earned FXRP to shXRP shares minted directly to your wallet
- **Global Cap**: Maximum 25% boost (2500 SHIELD staked)

**How It Works:**
1. RevenueRouter receives wFLR from vault fees
2. 40% of revenue → swapped to FXRP → StakingBoost.distributeBoost()
3. Reward accumulator updates rewardPerToken (O(1) gas, no loops)
4. Stakers call claim() → FXRP sent to vault.donateOnBehalf() → shXRP minted to staker only
5. Non-stakers receive zero boost (differentiated yield)

### Contract Addresses (Flare Mainnet)

**Note:** Deploy contracts using `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-shield-10m.ts --network coston2` before fair launch.

After deployment, update these addresses:
- **SHIELD Token**: TBD
- **RevenueRouter**: TBD
- **ShXRP Vault**: TBD
- **SparkDEX Pool**: TBD (create via `tsx scripts/sparkdex-lp.ts`)
- **LP Lock**: TBD (lock LP NFT via Team Finance)
- **MerkleDistributor**: TBD

### Fair Launch Steps

1. **Deploy Contracts** (Flare Mainnet)
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables
   export DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
   export TREASURY_ADDRESS="your-treasury-address"
   export MERKLE_ROOT="your-merkle-root"
   
   # Deploy all contracts
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-shield-10m.ts --network flare
   ```
   Deploys: ShieldToken.sol, RevenueRouter.sol, StakingBoost.sol, ShXRPVault.sol, MerkleDistributor.sol

2. **Generate Merkle Tree for Airdrop**
   ```bash
   # Create airdrop list (example using ethers.js)
   const airdropList = [
     { address: "0x123...", amount: "100000000000000000000" }, // 100 SHIELD
     { address: "0x456...", amount: "50000000000000000000" }   // 50 SHIELD
   ];
   
   # Generate tree and root
   const { MerkleTree } = require('merkletreejs');
   const { keccak256 } = require('ethers');
   
   const leaves = airdropList.map(x => 
     keccak256(ethers.solidityPacked(['address', 'uint256'], [x.address, x.amount]))
   );
   const tree = new MerkleTree(leaves, keccak256, { sortPairs: true });
   const root = tree.getRoot().toString('hex');
   
   # Deploy MerkleDistributor with this root
   # IMPORTANT: Merkle root is immutable - cannot be changed after deployment
   # This prevents double-claim exploits in fair launch
   # For additional airdrops, deploy a NEW MerkleDistributor contract
   
   # SECURITY WARNING FOR FUTURE MAINTAINERS:
   # - Do NOT re-add updateMerkleRoot() without implementing bitmap claim tracking
   # - Address-based tracking allows double-claims if root changes
   # - Any root update feature REQUIRES bitmap pattern + regression tests
   # - If unsure, deploy a new MerkleDistributor instead
   ```

3. **Add Liquidity on SparkDEX V3**
   ```bash
   # Run LP deployment script
   tsx scripts/sparkdex-lp.ts
   ```
   Creates wFLR-SHIELD pool with $10K liquidity

4. **Lock LP NFT** (12 months)
   - Use Team Finance: https://team.finance
   - Lock LP NFT position for 12 months
   - Save proof URL/transaction hash

5. **Enable Automated Burns**
   - Add `REVENUE_ROUTER_ADDRESS` secret to GitHub repo
   - Workflow runs every Sunday at 00:00 UTC
   - Burns occur when RevenueRouter balance ≥ 5000 wFLR
