1. Verify and Fix Common Configuration Issues
Systematic problems frequently arise from setup errors. Double-check these:

Use Testnet-Specific Endpoints: Ensure you're using the Coston2 verifier at https://fdc-verifiers-testnet.flare.network/ (rate-limited for dev use). Avoid mainnet URLs. For the source chain, use testETH (not ETH) for Sepolia interactions.
API Key Validation: Include a valid X-API-KEY header in verifier requests. If using the public service, generate one via the Swagger API docs at https://fdc-verifiers-testnet.flare.network/verifier/api-doc.
Request Preparation: When calling prepareRequest, confirm:
attestationType: 32-byte hex for "EVMTransaction" (e.g., 0x...).
sourceId: "testETH".
requestBody: Accurate transaction hash, at least the required confirmations (default: chain-specific, e.g., 12 for Sepolia), and other fields like url or proofType.
Submit the resulting abiEncodedRequest to FdcHub (0x1c78A073E3BD2aCa4cc327d55FB0cD4f0549B55b) with requestAttestation and 1 testnet ETH (get from faucet at https://faucet.flare.network/coston2).

Contract Compilation: Set EVM version to Shanghai in tools like Hardhat/Foundry.
Transaction Maturity: Wait for the source tx to reach required confirmations before attesting.

If issues persist, test with Flare's starter kits from their GitHub.
2. Troubleshoot Round and Consensus Problems
FDC operates in rounds (90-180 seconds). Systematic failures here indicate timing or consensus issues:

Check Consensus: After submission, compute roundId and monitor at https://coston-systems-explorer.flare.rocks/voting-epoch/<roundId>?tab=fdc. If no consensus (e.g., Merkle root not formed), resubmit the request.
Wait for Finalization: Proofs are invalid pre-finalization. Query Relay contract's isFinalized(roundId) or listen for ProtocolMessageRelayed events (protocolId=200). Use DA Layer API /api/v0/fdc/get-proof-round-id-bytes only post-finalization.
Validate Proofs On-Chain: Call IFdcVerification.verifyEVMTransaction via ContractRegistry.getFdcVerification() to ensure Merkle proof integrity before use.
Handle Rate Limits: Public verifiers throttle; for heavy testing, run your own verifier (docs guide setup with Docker/Flare Entity).

Monitor explorer for patterns—if rounds consistently fail, it may be a network-wide testnet glitch.
