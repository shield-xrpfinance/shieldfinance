You are an expert front-end developer specializing in DeFi dApps and user onboarding.

Project: https://shyield.finance/app  
GitHub repo: https://github.com/shield-xrpfinance/shieldfinance  
Whitepaper: https://shyield.finance/whitepaper.pdf

Task: Create a complete, production-ready plan and code to add a skippable, visual, step-by-step guided tour (tooltip walkthrough) for first-time DeFi users when they open https://shyield.finance/app for the first time.

Requirements:

1. The tour must be fully skippable at any moment ("Skip tour" + "×" button).
2. If the user completes or skips it, never show again (use localStorage flag).
3. Use one of the following modern, lightweight libraries (choose the best one):
   - Shepherd.js (preferred because it’s beautiful and actively maintained)
   - Driver.js
   - Intro.js
   - Or pure CSS + React if you prefer no extra dependency

4. The tour must have FOUR different scenarios/paths that auto-detect the user’s situation and show only the relevant one:
   Scenario 1 → Testnet user (wallet on testnet or no wallet yet)
   Scenario 2 → Mainnet (Coming Soon) → show a short "Mainnet is launching soon" modal + quick overview
   Scenario 3 → XRPL-only user (EVMOS/Flare not connected, only XRPL/Ethereum chains)
   Scenario 4 → Flare user (Flare network connected)

5. Make it extremely beginner-friendly. Explain in very simple language what each button does:
   - Connect Wallet
   - Switch network (if needed)
   - Deposit / Supply
   - Choose strategy (Conservative / Balanced / Aggressive)
   - Confirm transaction
   - View dashboard / yields
   - Withdraw, etc.

6. Design must be beautiful and on-brand with ShYield (dark mode, cyan/blue accents, clean sans-serif).

7. Output everything I need:
   Part 1 – Detailed implementation plan (where to put the code, how to detect network/wallet status)
   Part 2 – Exact package to install (e.g. npm i shepherd.js tether @shepherd/pro vX.X.X)
   Part 3 – Complete reusable React component (e.g. <ShYieldTour />) that starts automatically on first visit
   Part 4 – All tour steps (title, text, attachTo element selectors, buttons) for each of the 4 scenarios
   Part 5 – CSS overrides to match ShYield design perfectly
   Part 6 – How to integrate it into the existing repo (probably in src/components/Tour.tsx and call it from App.tsx or Layout.tsx)

Bonus points:
- Add a small "Need help?" floating button that can re-trigger the tour any time
- Progress indicator (Step 1 of 8)
- Mobile-responsive (works great on phone)

Give me everything ready to copy-paste and run. Prefer TypeScript + Vite/React (current stack of the repo).
