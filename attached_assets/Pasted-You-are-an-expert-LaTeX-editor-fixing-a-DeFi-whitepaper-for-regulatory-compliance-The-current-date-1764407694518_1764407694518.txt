You are an expert LaTeX editor fixing a DeFi whitepaper for regulatory compliance.

The current date is 29 November 2025. The project is LIVE on Coston2 testnet but NOT yet on mainnet. Mainnet launch is targeted for December 2025.

Go through the entire main.tex file and make ONLY the following replacements to remove all false or premature claims:

1. EVERY occurrence of "December 2025 (Mainnet Edition)" → change to "November 2025 (Testnet Live – Mainnet December 2025)"

2. EVERY occurrence of "December 2025" as the document date → change to "November 2025"

3. The big blue box that says "Mainnet LIVE — start earning yield now: app.shyield.finance" → replace entire tcolorbox with:
   \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=shieldlight,colframe=shieldblue,boxrule=1pt,arc=3pt,left=10pt,right=10pt,top=8pt,bottom=8pt]
   \centering
   \textbf{▶ Testnet LIVE on Coston2 (switch wallet to Coston2)}\\[0.3em]
   Mainnet launch targeted for December 2025\\[0.5em]
   Test it now: \texttt{app.shyield.finance}
   \end{tcolorbox}

4. The metrics subsection title:
   "Current Mainnet-Relevant Metrics (28 Nov 2025 — live data at app.shyield.finance)"
   → change to:
   "Current Testnet & Ecosystem Metrics \normalfont\small(29 Nov 2025 — on-chain verifiable data)"

5. In the metrics table, change the Security line from:
   "Hacken audit complete[4] · Trail of Bits Q1 2026"
   → to:
   "Asfalia audit complete · Hacken in progress · Trail of Bits Q1 2026"

6. In the Summary → Security & Audits table and Institutional Safeguards audit table, replace Hacken status from "Complete" or "In Progress" with accurate list:
   Asfalia → Complete (Nov 2025)
   Hacken → In Progress
   Trail of Bits → Scheduled Q1 2026

7. Roadmap table: change "Nov 2025 → Mainnet Launch" to:
   27 Nov 2025 → Testnet Launch (Coston2)
   December 2025 → Mainnet Launch

8. Contract addresses section: replace all "TBD — Mainnet deployment December 2025" with actual Coston2 testnet addresses (use placeholders if real ones unknown) and add line:
   Mainnet addresses: To be announced December 2025

9. Final page footer: change "December 2025 — Version 1.3 (Mainnet Edition)" → "November 2025 — Version 1.3 (Testnet Live – Mainnet December 2025)"

Do not change anything else — tokenomics, math, diagrams, or design. Only fix the false launch/audit/date claims listed above.

Apply all changes cleanly and output the full corrected main.tex.
